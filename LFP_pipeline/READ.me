The 'average_chans_and_filter_LFP.m' script contains a function which, for each LFP file in
the provided data directory, computes the average LFP signal across the channels considered
"good" by the corresponding CHANS file for each brain region and then notch filters the
averaged LFP signals at 60 Hz. The averaged and filtered LFP data files are then saved to
the provided directory (see function documentation).

Example code:
>>> lfp_data_dir = "./LFP_data/";
>>> chans_dir = "./CHANS/";
>>> save_dir = "./averaged_and_filtered_LFP_data/";
>>> fs = 1000;
>>> average_chans_and_filter_LFP(lfp_data_dir, chans_dir, save_dir, fs);

The 'compute_coherence_for_averaged_LFP.m' script contains a function which computes the
magnitude-squared coherence for each pair of brain regions at each time window for each LFP
file in the provided directory (see function documentation). The LFP files used by this
script should be those produced as the result of calling the 'average_chans_and_filter_LFP.m'
script.

>>> lfp_data_dir = "./averaged_and_filtered_LFP_data/";
>>> save_dir = "./coherence_results/";
>>> max_plot_freq = 50;
>>> win_len = 1;
>>> win_step = 1;
>>> fs = 1000;
>>> compute_coherence_for_averaged_LFP(lfp_data_dir, save_dir, max_plot_freq, win_len, win_step, fs);
